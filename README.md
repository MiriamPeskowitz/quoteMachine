# Origin-Change-Goals
This began as an assignment, of course. Once complete, in two modalities, array and API, I reimagined
it as part of a game hosted every few months by a friend. The game is called Cowgirls. It's inspirational, meant to be 
an afternoon's conversation rather than a clear sense of who wins. We've never made it past the first quarter of the board. The goal's to share stories and memories, to get to know inside each other's soul. 

Each player rolls one dice, moves her player and picks a card. The card has a fab cowgirl quote on one side. You read that, and then turn the card over and answer some questions (depending on the space you landed on). I wanted to create an app that rolls that dice and provides a quote. It'll be used on a mobile phone, but I'll write it as a web app, at least at first. I also hope to use dynamic JS, and eventually recode it in React, as I learn. 

Here's the thing: my friend has cancer. Right after the next Cowgirls, she's hopping on a plane for her next set of tests. i want her to be able to click this Cowgirl app on her phone, get some inspiration and feel the warmth of the afternoon together with friends.
